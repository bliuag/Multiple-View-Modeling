# Multiple-View-Modeling

Implement this paper: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1467260/

## Steps
1. Estimation of light direction. 
Seek the nearest light direction on an icosahedron of 1313 angles, then interpolate the image.

2. Calculate the dominator image.
To find the dominator image that is shadow-free and highlight-free, rank the images based on each pixels and pick the one with max number of pixels whose rank larger than `L` (which is larger than median) and mean rank of these pixels lower than some threshhold `H`.
Here we set `L` and `H` to be the 70th and 90th percentiles respectively.

3. Local normal estimation by ratio image
On each pixel, there were `k-1` number of equations based on the normal on this point, generated by the intensity ratio to the dominator image and the equation I = k* N.*L

4. Minimization via graph cuts
Define energy function for graph cut minimization: E(f) = E_data(f) + E_smoothness(f)
`E_data` describes the difference between input image and the generated based on the calculated normal and light.
`E_smoothness` describes the smoothness between each pixel and its neighborhood.

Here we use GCoptimization for the further optimization given the parameters.
